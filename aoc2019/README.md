# Advent of Code 2019

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2019][2019], each one in a
different language.

â€¦Well, except all Intcode-related solutions starting from the day 5: since all
of them are built atop the previous ones, they all reuse the same core in
Crystal (`common/intcode.cr`) and are thus written in that language.
