# Day 5 (Crystal)

Build:

    crystal build ./day5.cr

I used Crystal 0.31.1.

## Problem 1

    ./day5 <input.txt>

Then enter `1` when the program asks for an input.

## Problem 2

    ./day5 <input.txt>

Then enter `5` when the program asks for an input.

You can also pass the input as an argument:

    ./day5 --inputs=5 <input.txt>

`--inputs=1,2` would pass `1` for the first input and `2` for the second, if
there's one.
