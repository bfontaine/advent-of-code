# Day 5 (Crystal)

## Problem 1

    ./day5.cr <input.txt>

Then enter `1` when the program asks for an input.

## Problem 2

    ./day5.cr <input.txt>

Then enter `5` when the program asks for an input.

You can also pass the input as an argument:

    ./day5.cr -- --inputs=5 <input.txt>

`--inputs=1,2` would pass `1` for the first input and `2` for the second, if
there's one.
